In this GENE360 tutorial we will be using the R statistical software running in the RStudio 
application to perform data visualisation and analysis.

## Download the data

The data for this module are available from the GENE360 Blackboard page. 
Instructions for downloading the required files are contained in the 
`GENE360-popDiv.pdf` document.

## R and RStudio on your computer, or Student Desktop?

If you have problems getting R and RStudio installed (or accessing them via the Student Desktop), please get in touch with me via email: mik.black@otago.ac.nz

### Your computer

If you are using your own computer for this session, you will need to have R and RStudio installed.  Install or update R **before** you install or update RStudio.

To install the latest versions of R and RStudio Desktop, visit the following website, and follow the installation instructions:

https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

If you are running a version of R earlier than 3.6.1, that is probably okay, but just be aware that older versions of R do sometimes cause problems.

If you already have RStudio installed, you can upgrade to the latest version by choosing "Check for Updates" from the RStudio "Help" menu. 

### Running via the Windows App

Windows App is the replacement for the Otago Student Desktop:

If you have the Windows App installed on your computer, you can run RStudio by 
selecting it from the list of Core Applications.

## Getting started

**NB: you will be doing your analysis in RStudio, so don't worry about using the R application (it needs to be installed, but we don't have to open it) - just open RStudio and use that for all of your work.**

Once you have access to RStudio, you can get started with the work for the lab by downloading the file `GENE360-popDiv.pdf` from Blackboard.
